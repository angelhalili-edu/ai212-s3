Generating these entropy samples may take some time if there's no natural randomness occurring in the hardware at the moment. For example, an idle PC will take longer to fill-in the entropy samples than that of a PC being actively used where a mouse movement or the thermal signals of the CPU can contribute to the entropy.\n",
