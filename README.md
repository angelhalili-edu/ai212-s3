### Problem Set Instructions

For each item in this problem set, carefully work through the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**
   - Begin by discussing your understanding of the problem. Explain what the problem is asking and identify the key concepts involved.

2. **Solution Implementation**
   - Provide a detailed explanation of how you implemented your solution.
   - If applicable, include analytical derivations or setup of equations.
   - Discuss important parts of your code, explaining the key concepts and/or how they contribute to solving the problem.
   - Interpret the results of your solution.
   - Include screenshots of important parts of your solution process, such as intermediate outputs or calculations.
   - Provide relevant plots or visualizations to support your analysis and explain what the results mean in the context of the problem.

### Submission Requirements

- Integrate all the above steps into a Jupyter Notebook. Create one notebook for each problem item.
- Run all parts of your code to ensure everything works as expected.
- Export each completed notebook as a PDF file.
  - The PDF must include all code cells and their outputs
  - The PDFs for all items
  - A link to your Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Colab

### Important Reminders
